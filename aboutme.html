    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      &nbsp;Hello everybody,<br />
      <br />
      My name is Tim. Welcome to my website. I am an amatuer competitive shooter
      & avid sportsmen. During my 8 years in the military & competitive shooting
      experience, I have learned a lot & continue to be a student of tactics & the
      shooting sports.<br />
      <br />
      Currently, my favorite shooting sport is 2 gun, however, I am pretty open
      to anything that has fun, friends, & targets. My passion for guns &
      shooting became apparent after I joined the military & has been strongly
      supported by members of my family who are also shooting enthusiasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Army, I learned to regularly shoot expert in both service rifle
      (40/40) & service pistol (30/30). This in part helped me pursue other
      shooting opportunities. In 2018, I shot my 1st (25/25) perfect round of
      trap shooting. I attended my 1st

        >Project Appleseed shoot</a
      >. I am very thankful to have come home with a distinguished rifleman
      rating using iron sights (score 230 & above out of 250). We will continue to update the website as events occur.
      <p>
        Enough about me.
      </p>
      <p>
        What about you?
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>If you are already a shooter, I hope to see you at the range.</li>
          <li>If you are new to guns & shooting, I hope you will find something that will spark your interest. As the sponsored shooter Rob Leatham says, gun ownership is something we cannot and should not take for granted. The shooting sports are a great way to connect with like minded people.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to learn more about guns and the shooting sports, I highly suggest you take these steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Visit your local shooting range</li>
        <li>Take a firearm safety course</li>
        <li>Take a concealed weapons course</li>
        <li>Check out your local clubs & shooting events</li>
        <li>Attend a shooting competition</li>
        <li>Buy a pistol & eventually a rifle & shotgun from your local gun store & do all of the above!</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Be warned, the shooting sports are highly addictive & enjoyable! Above all, be responsible, be safe, & make sure to protect yourself & your loved ones.</p>
